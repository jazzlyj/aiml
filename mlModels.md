# Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) Machine Learning (ML) is a subset within AI associated with providing machines the ability to learn from experience without the need to be programmed explicitly. 

ML or machine learning is a part of AI. All ML models are, by default, AI models, the opposite may not always be true. 

# Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning

## Supervised learning 
The algorithm is given a set of training data. 

Supervised models learn from ground truth data that was labeled manually by data scientists. 

The model uses this data to learn (training) how to make predictions on new data (inferencing). 

## Unsupervised learning 
The algorithm is given raw data that is not annotated. 

The algorithm is not explicitly told what to do with it and must learn how to make predictions by itself. 

This type of ML model is suitable to perform specific tasks on distinct data types, for example, fraud detection or financial analysis, that require identifying a hidden structure in unlabeled data.

# What Is An AI Model? 
a tool or algorithm which is based on a certain data set through which it can arrive at a decision â€“ all without the need for human interference in the decision-making process. 

a program or algorithm that utilizes a set of data that enables it to recognize certain patterns. 

This allows it to reach a conclusion or make a prediction when provided with sufficient information, often a huge amount of data. 

AI models are particularly suitable for solving complex problems while providing higher efficiency/cost savings and accuracy compared to simple methods.


# What Is An ML Model? 
is a kind of AI model that uses a mathematical formula to make predictions about future events. 

* Trained on a set of data and then used to make predictions about new data. Some common examples of ML models include regression models and classification models.   

# What Is A DL Model? 
A deep learning model, or a DL model, is a neural network that has been trained to learn how to perform a task, such as recognizing objects in digital images and videos, or understanding human speech. 

* Trained by using large sets of data and algorithms that enable the model to learn how to perform the task. 

The more data the model is trained on, the better it can learn to perform the task.
