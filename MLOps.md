# MLOps (machine learning operations)
Definition: Includes the culmination of people, processes, practices and underpinning technologies that automate the deployment, monitoring, and management of machine learning (ML) models into production in a scalable and fully governed way to finally provide measurable business value from machine learning.



# MLOps infrastructure
Can be represented by something as simple as a set of vetted and maintained processes. For example:

* How models are created, trained and approved
* Where models are stored
* How models are deployed
* How models are evaluated and monitored in production
* How models are either corrected or removed from the production environment to minimize risks
* How these processes repeat and intertwine to enable a cyclical machine learning operations process
